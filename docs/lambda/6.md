# Chapter 6: Minimal Calculus

## Lambda Calculus

All functions in lambda calculus could be reduced into following minimal functions, or combinators:

$$
\lambda x.x\\
\lambda x.c\\
\lambda x.yz
$$

The first one returns its parameter unchanged. The second one returns a free variable captured from outer scope, which is considered as constant to the inner function itself. The third one provokes an application.

## SKI Calculus

But there is a more famous set of combinators, called SKI Caculus.

$$
\begin{array}{}
\text{let}&\left\{
\begin{array}{}
I&=&\lambda x.x \\
K&=&\lambda xy.x \\
S&=&\lambda xyz.xz(yz)\\
\end{array}\right.\\
\text{then}&\left\{
\begin{array}{}
\lambda x.x &=& I\\
\lambda x.c &=& Kc\\
\lambda x.yz &=& S (\lambda x.y) (\lambda x.z)\\
\end{array}\right.\\
\end{array}
$$

Then we can learn calculus again.

$$
T=K\\
F=SK\\
\text{not}=S(SI(KF))(KT)\\
\text{and}=SS(K(KF))\\
\text{or}=SI(KT)\\
\vdots
$$

Don't wanna enumerate more. You may try it by yourself.

## SK Calculus

However, $I$ is actually not primitive. It could still be rewritten as:

$$
I=SKK=SKS
$$

Then we get SK Calculus! Can we dive deeper into this? Sure!


## Iota Calculus

Don't close your mouth while watching this magic.

$$
\begin{array}{}
\text{let}&\space\space\space
\iota=\lambda f.fSK\\
\text{then}&\left\{
\begin{array}{}
I &&&=& \iota\iota\\
K &=& \iota(\iota I) &=& \iota(\iota(\iota\iota))\\
S &=& \iota(K) &=& \iota(\iota(\iota(\iota\iota)))\\
\end{array}\right.\\
\end{array}
$$

Don't verify these equations by hand. 会变得不幸。别问我怎么知道的。

Yes, it reach the top of minimalism! Only one combinator! Since iota calculus is so minimal, it is possible to transform it into a kind of binary tree, with iota as leaf node and application order (by functionality of parentheses) as internal node. Furthermore, the tree could be then encoded as pre-order, i. e.

```
iota := "1" | "0" iota iota
```

Which means an iota expression should be either 1 or 0, 1 stands for iota itself and 0 is followed by another two iota expressions. For example 0011011 denotes $((\iota \iota )(\iota \iota ))$, and 0101011 denotes $\iota (\iota (\iota \iota ))$.

Long long ago you might have been told that computer programs are all stored in binary form in computers. Well, now binary is here, where were you?

## BCKW System

And yes, alternative systems exist, such as BCKW system:

$$
\begin{array}{}
\text{let}&\left\{
\begin{array}{}
B&=&\lambda xyz.x(yz) \\
C&=&\lambda xyz.xzy \\
K&=&\lambda xy.x\\
W&=&\lambda xy.xyy
\end{array}\right.\\
\text{then}&\left\{
\begin{array}{}
B&=&S(KS)K\\
C&=&S(S(K(S(KS)K))S)(K K)\\
K&=&K\\
W&=&SS(SK)
\end{array}\right.\\
\text{and}&\left\{
\begin{array}{}
I&=&WK\\
K&=&K\\
S&=&B(B(BW)C)(BB)&=&B(B W)(BBC)\\
\end{array}\right.\\
\end{array}
$$
